## 🚀 THE FASTEST WAY (3 Steps)

### Step 1️⃣: Create GitHub Repository
**Time: 2 minutes**

Go to: **https://github.com/new**

Fill in:
- Name: `campus-Me`
- Description: `AI-powered academic document generation suite`
- Visibility: **PUBLIC** ✅
- License: **MIT** ✅

Click: "Create repository"

**Copy the HTTPS URL** (example: `https://github.com/your_username/campus-Me.git`)

---

### Step 2️⃣: Add GitHub Remote & Push
**Time: 1 minute**

**In PowerShell:**

```powershell
cd c:\Users\User\Desktop\campus-Me

# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add github https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/campus-Me.git

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!

# Push to GitHub
git push github main
```

When asked for password: Use your GitHub **Personal Access Token** (see below)

---

### Step 3️⃣: Verify
**Time: 1 minute**

Visit: **https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/campus-Me**

You should see all your files! ✅

---

## 🔑 Getting GitHub Credentials (For Step 2️⃣)

If GitHub asks for a password, use a **Personal Access Token**:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Fill in:
   - Token name: `campus-me-token`
   - Expiration: 90 days (or longer)
   - Select: ✅ `repo` (Full control of repositories)
4. Click: "Generate token"
5. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
6. **Save it somewhere safe** (like a password manager)
7. When Git asks for password: **Paste the token**

---

## 🔄 Push to BOTH Services (HF + GitHub)

Now you have TWO remotes:

```powershell
# Current setup:
origin  → HuggingFace Spaces (where people use your app)
github  → GitHub (where people see your code)
```

**Push to both:**

```powershell
# Method 1: Push one at a time
git push origin main      # Deploy to HuggingFace
git push github main      # Publish to GitHub

# Method 2: Push to both at once
git push origin main; git push github main
```

---

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ HuggingFace Setup (Already Done)
