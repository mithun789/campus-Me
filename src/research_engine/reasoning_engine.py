        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: AI Capabilities, Limitations, and Human Advantages
        
        This research demonstrates that AI and humans have fundamentally different strengths:
        
        AI EXCELS AT:
        - Pattern recognition at massive scale (billions of patterns/second)
        - Mathematical and logical computation
        - Data processing and analysis
        - Narrow domain optimization
        - Consistent task automation
        
        AI STRUGGLES WITH:
        - True understanding and comprehension
        - Genuine creativity and novelty
        - Common sense reasoning
        - Transfer learning across domains
        - Long-term strategic planning
        - Ethical reasoning and moral judgment
        - Any task requiring consciousness or intentionality
        
        HUMANS EXCEL AT:
        - Creativity and generating novel ideas
        - General intelligence and flexible learning
        - Emotional and social intelligence
        - Long-term strategic thinking
        - Moral and ethical reasoning
        - Meaning-making and purpose
        - Complex social collaboration
        - Embodied, physical understanding
        
        FUTURE DIRECTION:
        Rather than AI replacing humans, the most effective approach is
        complementary collaboration where AI handles computation and
        pattern recognition, while humans provide creativity, judgment,
        and ethical guidance.
